# My website name  "Journey Junction"
 I created a responsive tourism management website focused on Southeast Asia. The site features dynamic tourist spot displays, user authentication, and CRUD operations. It includes protected routes, country sections, a dark/light theme toggle, and integrates Lottie React and React-simple-typewriter for an enhanced user experience.
